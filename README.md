## Amazon Surrealism 
#### by Courtney Crother 


### Overview

In this game you travel through Amazon until you find the workers manifesto. As you travel you will encounter Bezos heads that will restart the game if you touch them and Bernie heads that will take you to the manifesto if you touch them. At the very end there is a list of ways to help Amazon workers. 

### Technical Details

In this project I used the Moody Maze template to make my game and used the PNG extends function to place my NPCs in the game. I also used the sound library to add music to the game. I do think I should have added that you have a certain amount of lives that you get to used or you die, but it didn't happen. My project code is very straighforward because I am not the best coder, but I am happy I made a playable game and that I understood the PNG extends function.
